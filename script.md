# TaskHub AI - Hackathon Submission Podcast Script (Natural - <3 mins)

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (Speaker 1 - ~30 seconds)

Speaker 1: "Okay, real talk—how many tasks are you actually juggling right now? Be honest. [laughs] Everyone's drowning, right? Work stuff, personal stuff, random ideas... they're everywhere. Slack, email, notes, your brain. But here's the thing—it's not that we're lazy. It's that actually capturing a task is such a pain. And once you finally write it down, it just sits in a list somewhere. It doesn't feel real."

## SECTION 2: THE INSIGHT (Speaker 2 - ~45 seconds)

Speaker 2: "Okay, but there's actually research on this. It's called the calendaring approach. And the idea is simple: if something's on your calendar, you actually do it. Way more likely than if it's just on a to-do list.

Think about it—you've got a 2 PM meeting? You're there. You've got 'finish the presentation' on a list? That lives in limbo forever. [laughs] Why? Because when it's on your calendar, it's real. It has a time, a place in your actual day. And there's all this research showing that just seeing it there helps you focus better, actually get it done.

Most productivity tools miss this. Getting tasks into your calendar is annoying. That's the gap TaskHub fills."

## SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION (Speaker 1 - ~40 seconds)

Speaker 1: "So we built a Chrome plugin where you can capture tasks three ways. Voice—you just hit a button and talk: 'I need to finish the report by Friday.' Text, if you're reading something. Or you capture what's on your screen.

But here's the magic—we use Google AI to figure everything out. You say one sentence, it automatically sets the priority, deadline, project, everything. All the structure without the work. You capture naturally, it organizes, boom—it's in your calendar."

## SECTION 4: WHY TASKHUB IS DIFFERENT (Speaker 2 - ~40 seconds)

Speaker 2: "So what makes it different from other apps?

First—privacy. Everything stays on your machine. No uploading your life to the cloud. Your data is yours.

Second—it's simple. You just capture. No forms, no friction.

Third—calendar-based from the start, which is backed by actual research.

And fourth—real AI understanding context, not just basic pattern matching. Plus it's Chrome-native so you're already there."

## SECTION 5: CLOSING (Both Speakers - ~30 seconds)

Speaker 1: "We built this for the Google Chrome AI Hackathon. Big thanks to Google and Devpost for pushing us to actually solve what's broken with productivity."

Speaker 2: "TaskHub is for people who are overwhelmed and want to actually finish what they start—without their privacy getting sold."

Speaker 1: "If you're tired of productivity tools that feel like work..."

Speaker 2: "Check out TaskHub."

Both: "Thanks."
